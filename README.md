# SQUIDL - Your Privacy-Focused Payment Platform üöÄ

**SQUIDL** is a next-gen payment platform designed for freelancers, businesses, and individuals who value security and anonymity. By leveraging the power of the **Oasis Protocol**, SQUIDL allows you to create **private static payment links** using stealth addresses, ensuring every transaction is **secure, private, and untraceable**.

## üåü Key Features

### 1. Privacy-First Payments with Stealth Addresses

- **Customizable Payment Links**: Create personalized links like `john.squidl.me` that generate a unique stealth address each time they're accessed.
- **Alias Support**: Use aliases like `payment.john.squidl.me` or `freelance.john.squidl.me` for different contexts‚Äîall while keeping your transactions private.
- **Simplicity at its Best**: Distribute a single link or ENS address without worrying about privacy breaches or complex setups.

### 2. Enhanced Privacy with Oasis Protocol

- **Overcoming Traditional Limitations**: We've streamlined the ERC-5564 standard, making stealth transactions as straightforward as regular transfers.
- **Secure Key Management**: Thanks to Oasis Sapphire's confidential computing, your private keys stay private‚Äîno exposure to insecure environments.
- **Lower Gas Fees**: Optimized stealth address generation reduces computational resources and gas costs.
- **No Privacy Leaks**: By eliminating unnecessary on-chain events, we ensure your transactions remain confidential and untraceable.

### 3. Seamless ENS Integration

- **Easy Access with ENS**: Each payment link is also an ENS address, like `john.squidl.eth`, enhancing compatibility with wallets and dApps.
- **Broad Compatibility**: Leveraging ENS ensures you can interact with the platform using existing blockchain tools.

### 4. Secure Backups with Oasis Sapphire ROFL

- **Data Integrity and Security**: We integrate with Oasis Sapphire's ROFL to securely back up stealth address data without relying solely on backend storage.
- **Automatic Activity Detection**: Our system monitors for any activity on your stealth addresses without revealing any addresses or secrets.
- **Resilient and Reliable**: Even if our backend faces issues, your stealth addresses remain safe and accessible.

### 5. Private Transfers via Oasis Sapphire

- **Complete Privacy**: Utilize our "Private Transfer" feature to bridge assets to Oasis Sapphire and wrap them into private tokens like `pethUSDC`.
- **Breaking Transaction Links**: By wrapping assets, transactions become opaque, breaking any link between sender and receiver.

### 6. Developer-Friendly Integration

- **`StealthSdk.sol`**: We've developed a smart contract deployable on any EVM-compatible chain supported by Sapphire OPL, allowing users to register without needing Oasis Sapphire's native currency upfront.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Starting with Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, Linea, EVM on Flow, and Morph (Testnet), with plans to expand further.

## üåê Enhancing the Oasis Protocol Ecosystem

By integrating features like ROFL and supporting private wrapped tokens, SQUIDL doesn't just use the Oasis Protocol‚Äîit enhances it!

- **Boosting Network Activity**: Our platform brings more transactions and liquidity to the Oasis Sapphire network.
